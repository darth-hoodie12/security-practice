What do you want?
'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me
So I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there
Who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down
I'm not where I'm meant to be?
Every day's a little harder
As I feel my power grow
Don't you know there's part of me
That longs to go
Into the unknown
